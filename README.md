# dilli.wiki

I have been a dilli boy forever, and I can confidently say that I know this city better than most others.

This is a local's (mine) guide to everything you need to know about falling in love with Dili. From authentic food spots to banger date locations - click on a spot, find the location and start the car (or take the metro).

Hope you like it. If you know more spots I should add here, or went to a place I have mentioned, tell me about it at [@paarugsethi](https://twitter.com/paarugsethi).
